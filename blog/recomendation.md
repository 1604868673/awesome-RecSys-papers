# Writing Practice

## Introduction

---

Personalized recommendation of relevant content is a common task in many retrieval systems. Many collaborative filtering approaches [1] attempt to identify user preferences based on explicit feedback such as user ratings. However, implicit feedback[2], in which a user’s preferences are expressed through item interactions such as views or purchases, is often more common than explicit feedback.
